# Programming Fundamentals

### 1. What is programming?
Programming is the process of creating instructions (code) for a computer to perform specific tasks or solve problems.

### 2. What is a flowchart?
A flowchart is a visual representation of a process or algorithm, using different shapes to represent different steps and arrows to show the flow of control or data.

### 3. How can flowcharts be helpful in programming?
Flowcharts help programmers visualize the logic of their code, plan algorithms, identify potential issues, and communicate complex processes more effectively.

### 4. What are the basic symbols used in flowcharts?
Basic symbols used in flowcharts include:
- Rectangles (for process steps)
- Diamonds (for decisions or conditionals)
- Ovals (for start and end points)
- Arrows (for flow direction)

### 5. Describe the purpose of a decision symbol in a flowchart.
A decision symbol is used to represent a conditional statement or decision point in a process, where the flow of control diverges based on a certain condition being true or false.
