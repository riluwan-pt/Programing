# ReactJS

1.  **How does ReactJS facilitate the development of Single Page
    Applications?**\
    ReactJS facilitates SPA development by allowing developers to create
    reusable UI components. These components can be composed together to
    build complex user interfaces, and React's virtual DOM efficiently
    updates the view when the underlying data changes, enhancing
    performance.

2.  **What is ReactJS?**\
    ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces,
    particularly for single-page applications. It allows developers to
    create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the state of
    their applications.

3.  **How does ReactJS differ from other JavaScript frameworks?**\
    Unlike traditional MVC frameworks, ReactJS emphasizes a
    component-based architecture, making it easier to build and maintain
    complex UIs. It also uses a virtual DOM for efficient rendering,
    resulting in better performance.

4.  **What is styling components using a separate CSS file in
    ReactJS?**\
    Styling components using a separate CSS file in ReactJS involves
    separating the styling code from the component code into distinct
    files. This allows for better organization and maintenance of styles
    within a React application.

5.  **How do you link a separate CSS file to a React component?**\
    To link a separate CSS file to a React component, you import the CSS
    file at the top of the component file using the `import` statement.
    For example:\

``` javascript
import './ComponentStyles.css';
```

6.  **What is Styling using module.css in ReactJS?**\
    Styling using module.css in ReactJS refers to the practice of
    encapsulating CSS styles within individual component files using the
    `.module.css` extension. This approach helps in avoiding global
    style conflicts and provides better modularity and maintainability
    for React applications.

7.  **Why is it advantageous to use module.css for styling in
    ReactJS?**\
    Using module.css helps maintain component encapsulation, enhances
    code readability, and minimizes the risk of style clashes between
    different parts of the application.

8.  **Can you explain how to import and use a module.css file in a React
    component?**\
    To use a module.css file in a React component, you import it at the
    top of the component file like so:\

``` javascript
import styles from './ComponentName.module.css';
```

Then, you can apply the styles to elements within the component using
the styles object, such as:

``` jsx
<div className={styles.container}>
```

9.  **What are CSS classes in ReactJS?**\
    CSS classes in ReactJS are used to apply styling to elements in the
    user interface.

10. **Why is it beneficial to use separate CSS files for styling React
    components?**\
    Using separate CSS files for styling React components promotes
    modularity and reusability. It also enhances code readability and
    maintainability by keeping the styling code separate from the
    component logic.

11. **What are the advantages of using props to pass data between
    components?**\
    Props provide a straightforward and efficient way to share data
    between components, promoting modularity, reusability, and
    maintainability in React applications.

12. **What is prop drilling in ReactJS?**\
    Prop drilling is the process of passing down props through multiple
    layers of components in a React application, even when intermediate
    components do not directly use those props.

13. **What is a component state variable in ReactJS?**\
    In ReactJS, a component state variable is a special type of variable
    that allows components to manage and update their own data. It's
    used to store information that can change over time, such as user
    input or dynamic content.

14. **When should you use state variables in ReactJS?**\
    State variables should be used when you need to manage and update
    data within a component that may change over time in response to
    user interactions or other events.

15. **What is an API call in ReactJS?**\
    An API call in ReactJS is a request made to an external server or
    service to fetch or send data, typically using the `fetch()`
    function or third-party libraries like Axios.

16. **How do you make an API call in ReactJS?**\
    To make an API call in ReactJS, you typically use the `fetch()`
    function or third-party libraries like Axios. You send a request to
    the desired endpoint and handle the response asynchronously.

17. **What is the useEffect hook in ReactJS?**\
    The `useEffect` hook in ReactJS is a built-in hook that allows
    functional components to perform side effects. It's commonly used
    for tasks like fetching data, subscribing to external events, or
    manually changing the DOM.

18. **How does styling with module.css differ from traditional CSS?**\
    Traditional CSS applies styles globally across all elements of a
    webpage, while styling with module.css confines styles to specific
    components, preventing unintended style conflicts.

19. **How can you use multiple CSS classes in an element in ReactJS?**\
    You can use multiple CSS classes in an element by separating them
    with a space within the `className` attribute.

20. **Why would you use multiple CSS classes in an element?**\
    Using multiple CSS classes allows you to apply different styles to
    an element or to combine styles from different classes.

21. **What is conditional rendering in ReactJS?**\
    Conditional rendering in ReactJS is the process of displaying
    different UI elements or components based on certain conditions.

22. **What is the purpose of passing data from a parent component to a child component in ReactJS?**\
    The purpose is to enable communication between components by
    allowing the parent component to share data with its child
    components.

23. **How do you pass data from a parent component to a child component in ReactJS?**\
    Data can be passed by assigning values to props (short for
    properties) in the parent component and then accessing those props
    in the child component.

24. **How can prop drilling be mitigated or avoided in ReactJS?**\
    Prop drilling can be mitigated by using techniques such as Context
    API, state management libraries like Redux, or by restructuring
    components to minimize the need for passing props through multiple
    layers.

25. **How do you update the value of a state variable in ReactJS?**\
    To update the value of a state variable in ReactJS, you use the
    function returned by the `useState` hook. This function is commonly
    named with a prefix of "set", followed by the name of the state
    variable.\
    For example, if the state variable is named `count`, the
    corresponding update function would be named `setCount`.

26. **How do you handle API call errors in ReactJS?**\
    API call errors in ReactJS can be handled by using `try...catch`
    blocks when making the API call, or by using `.catch()` method with
    Promises. Additionally, error handling can be implemented within the
    `useEffect` hook using state to manage loading and error states.

27. **What is the Context API in ReactJS?**\
    The Context API in ReactJS provides a way to pass data through the
    component tree without having to pass props manually at every level.

28. **How do you create a context in ReactJS?**\
    To create a context in ReactJS, you use the `createContext()`
    function from the `react` package. This function returns a Provider
    and Consumer, which can be used to pass data down the component tree
    and consume it at lower levels.

29. **When should you use the Context API instead of props drilling?**\
    You should use the Context API when you have data that needs to be
    accessed by many components at different levels of the component
    tree, and passing it via props would be cumbersome and lead to prop
    drilling.

30. **How do you create a navigation link in ReactJS using react-router-dom?**\
    You can use the `<Link>` component provided by `react-router-dom` to
    create navigation links in ReactJS. It allows users to navigate
    between different routes without a full page reload.

31. **What is the difference between `<Link>` and `<NavLink>` in react-router-dom?**\
    `<NavLink>` is a special version of `<Link>` that provides
    additional styling capabilities for the active route. It applies an
    active class to the link when its `to` route matches the current
    URL.

32. **How can you navigate to a different page programmatically in ReactJS using useNavigate?**\
    You can use the `useNavigate` hook provided by `react-router-dom` to
    programmatically navigate to a different route. It returns a
    function that you can call to navigate to a specific route.

33. **Can you provide an example of using multiple CSS classes in ReactJS?**\

``` jsx
<div className="button primary">Submit</div>
```

In this example, the element has both the "button" class and the
"primary" class applied to it, which combines styles for a primary
button.

34. **How do you use variables in JSX within ReactJS?**\
    Variables can be used within JSX by enclosing them in curly braces
    `{}`.\
    For example:\

``` jsx
const name = "John";
<h1>Hello, {name}</h1>
```

35. **What are the advantages of using ReactJS?**\
    ReactJS offers several advantages such as improved performance,
    reusable components, virtual DOM for faster updates, and a strong
    community support for problem-solving and learning resources.

36. **What is a component in ReactJS?**\
    A component in ReactJS is a reusable building block that
    encapsulates a piece of user interface and its behavior. It can be
    thought of as a small, self-contained unit that can be composed
    together to create complex user interfaces.

37. **How do you create a component in ReactJS?**\
    To create a component in ReactJS, you typically define a JavaScript
    function or class that returns JSX (JavaScript XML) to describe the
    component's UI. This JSX represents the structure and content of the
    component.

38. **What are the benefits of creating components in ReactJS?**\
    Creating components in ReactJS promotes code reusability,
    maintainability, and scalability. Components can be easily reused
    across different parts of an application, making it simpler to
    manage and update the user interface.

39. **What is JSX in ReactJS?**\
    JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for
    JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within
    JavaScript. JSX makes it easier to write and visualize the structure
    of React components.

40. **How do you create a new React app?**\
    You can create a new React app using Create React App, a
    command-line tool that sets up a new React project with a predefined
    folder structure and build configuration. Simply run:\

``` bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

in your terminal, replacing "my-app" with the name of your project.

41. **What is npm in ReactJS?**\
    npm stands for Node Package Manager. It's a tool used to manage
    packages and dependencies in a ReactJS project.

42. **What is npx in ReactJS?**\
    npx is a package runner tool that comes with npm. It's used to
    execute packages without having to install them globally.

43. **How do npm and npx differ in ReactJS?**\
    npm is used for package management and dependency installation,
    while npx is used to execute packages without installation.

44. **What is npm start in ReactJS?**\
    `npm start` is a command used to run a ReactJS project. It starts
    the development server, allowing developers to preview their
    application locally during the development process.

45. **What is a Single Page Application (SPA) in ReactJS?**\
    A Single Page Application (SPA) in ReactJS is a web application that
    operates within a single HTML page. It dynamically updates the
    content of the page as the user interacts with it, providing a
    smoother and more seamless user experience.

46. **What are the key advantages of using a Single Page Application approach in ReactJS?**\
    Single Page Applications in ReactJS offer advantages such as faster
    navigation, as only the necessary data is fetched from the server,
    reduced server load, improved user experience due to seamless
    interactions, and the ability to build complex interfaces while
    maintaining code organization and reusability.

47. **What is ReactDOM in ReactJS?**\
    ReactDOM is a package in ReactJS that provides methods for rendering
    React components in the DOM (Document Object Model). It's
    responsible for updating the user interface with React components.

48. **How does ReactDOM differ from React?**\
    ReactDOM is specifically focused on rendering React components in
    the DOM, whereas React is the library responsible for building
    component-based user interfaces in general.

49. **Why is ReactDOM.render() important in ReactJS?**\
    `ReactDOM.render()` is a method used to render React elements into
    the DOM. It's crucial because it initiates the rendering process and
    updates the DOM with React component changes.

50. **How can React Strict Mode be enabled in a React application?**\
    React Strict Mode can be enabled by wrapping the root component of a
    React application with `<React.StrictMode>` tags in the main
    rendering file, typically `index.js` or `App.js`. This activates the
    strict mode checks for all components within the application.
